# CQRS Pattern â€“ Student Registration System-in-AWS

I have designed CQRS (Command, Query, Responsibility Segregation) patterned solution for student registration system using AWS services. Created two RDS (Relational Database Service) mysql databases . one is write db and other is read db which is replica of write db and this maintains consistency between two databases. The EC2 instance is used to create the schema and tables in the RDS instance. The postman application is to handle the requests from students to register and enroll/disenroll from courses. Amazon Simple Queuse Service (SQS) carries the message through a queue and triggers a lambda function. DML operations are directed to write lambda function and read queries are directed to query function. The write lambda function consists of python code related to create/insert/update/delete the information in the MySQL Server using Relational Database Service (RDS). The query lambda function consists of python code related to retrieving the information from the MySQL Server using Relational Database Service (RDS). Cloud watch is used to monitor the students requests.
